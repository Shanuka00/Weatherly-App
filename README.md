Welcome to Weatherly, a simple weather app created by Shanuka Dilshan

#Getting Started

This weather app utilizes two APIs to provide accurate weather information

    First API   :   Retrieves the latitude and longitude of a location based on its name.
    Second API  :   Fetches detailed weather data for a specific location using its latitude and longitude.

Here's how it works

    • Enter the name of a city in the search bar to get started.
    • The app uses the first API to obtain the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the specified city.
    • With the obtained coordinates, the second API is called to retrieve the current weather details for the city.
    • The weather information is then displayed in a user-friendly interface.

Additionally, you can customize the temperature unit

    • Click on the settings icon to access the settings page.
    • Toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit based on your preference.

That's it! Enjoy exploring the weather with Weatherly.
